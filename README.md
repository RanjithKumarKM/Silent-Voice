Silent Voice

Silent Voice is a sign language recognition project designed to help deaf and mute individuals communicate more easily with others.  
The system captures hand gestures and converts them into meaningful text or speech using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

Features

- Real-time hand gesture recognition  
- Converts sign language gestures into text  
- Simple and user-friendly interface  
- Built using Python and computer vision  
- Can be extended to voice output in the future  



Technologies Used

- Python     
- OpenCV  
- Machine Learning  
- NumPy  
- HTML and CSS (if frontend is used)
